               <p class="text-capitalize text-muted text-sucess">A church service (or a service of worship) is a formalized period of Christian communal worship, often held in a church building. It often but not exclusively occurs on Sunday, or Saturday in the case of those churches practicing seventh-day Sabbatarianism. The church service is the gathering together of Christians to be taught the "Word of God" (the Christian Bible) and encouraged in their faith. Technically, the "church" in "church service" refers to the gathering of the faithful rather than to the building in which it takes place. In most Christian traditions, services are presided over by clergy wherever possible.

                Styles of service vary greatly, from the Anglican, Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, Presbyterian, Roman Catholic, and Lutheran traditions of liturgical worship to the evangelical Protestant style, that often combines worship with teaching for the believers, which may also have an evangelistic component appealing to the non-Christians or skeptics in the congregation. Quakers and some other groups have no formal outline to their services, but allow the worship to develop as the participants present feel moved.
                
                The majority of Christian denominations hold church services on the Lord's Day (with many offering Sunday morning and Sunday evening services); a number of traditions have mid-week Wednesday evening services as well.[A][2] In some Christian denominations, church services are held daily, with these including those in which the canonical hours are prayed, as well as the offering of the Mass, among other forms of worship.[3] In addition to this, many Christians attend services of worship on holy days such as Christmas, Ash Wednesday, Good Friday, Ascension Thursday, among others depending on the Christian denomination</p>

        <p class="text-capitalize text-muted text-sucess">My school library is a well set-up library. It is a very big library on the ground floor of the school that consists of several bookstands and cabinets. Books are precisely arranged in alphabetical order in these bookstands and cabinets. It has a wide range of books on diverse subjects, story books, comic books, biographies and magazines. At the entrance there is the librarian’s desk. There are rows of tables and chairs in the centre of the library for students to sit. Another section is the reference section of the library house for teachers.

            All the students visit library as per their classroom visit schedule. Library cards are to be carried to visit library. Our librarian is very helpful in locating and selecting books as per our needs. We are allowed to borrow one book at a time and the records for the same are maintained by the librarian. We need to ensure that the books are not damaged by us and are returned on time.
            
            Library is the best place to read without any disturbance. I love reading and writing so visiting the library for me is really very exciting. I can spend my entire day in the library.</p>

In most schools, the assembly hall has multiple uses including an auditorium where recreational activities and celebrations could take place, daily prayers can be held.

            The principal can address or conduct a meeting for all the students and teachers simultaneously, curricular and creative activities such as dramatics, music, debates etc. can be carried out.</p>

  <p>Today we had our School Debate contest and I was shortlisted in the A team. The topic given was Environment pollution and I was really excited as it is a topic close to my heart. The judges were from ABC Technical College, and the BCD University and they looked very stern and strict to me.      Our team started off well as it had most of the brain boxes of our school. Everyone contributed equally to the debate. In the end, when the judges announce the winner, we were overjoyed! The judges commented that though the B team fought well, it was the A team which had knowledge and fluency on its side!</p>

  <p>I am very happy today as my school team won the first position in inter-school debate competition in the city last week. As many as 60 students from 15 States participated in it. The topic of the debate was ‘Has Demonetization Achieved Its Goals?’ I spoke in favour of the motion. I gave arguments to support my debate. I quoted facts and figures quite confidently. The best part was the judges liked my expression and presentation. At the end I was given a thundering applause. I was so happy when my name was announced for the first position. At school also I received so much praise and appreciation from the principal. My parents were also very happy at my achievement. That’s all dear diary. Good night.

    <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">My school is a very big one and it has a very modern canteen. It is perhaps the most popular place in the school. It becomes very busy during the break times very difficult to find a seat to sit on during those times, so we have to stand and eat.
      Our school canteen is very well equipped. One can buy almost every kind of snack there, like samosas, chips, sandwiches, sweet, cakes etc. They are prepared in very hygienic surroundings by our school cook, and tables to sit on and eat, and ovens to keep the food warm. There is also a soda fountain which is Very popular among the older students.
      
      All the students love to sit in the canteen and discuss the events of the day. The noise level is always very high in the canteen as everyone is shouting to make himself heard. There are notice boards and suggestion boxes which all students are freely. There is also a separate enclosure for teachers. The cook charges very reasonable rates from us.
      
      I think that the school canteen is my favorite place in the school. I always enjoy myself there, and look forward to the recess when I can rush to the canteen with my friends</p>

    <h4>Implemented Online Attendance Management System</h4>
    <img src="attendance.jpg" class="img-responsive col-lg-5 col-md-5 col-sm-5 col-xs-12 ">
    <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">A student attendance management system keeps a track of attendance of its students for purposes such as tracking student’s progress in terms of class-wise attendance and behavioral analysis.

      An online attendance management system for students eases the task of attendance taking besides helping schools manage data on real time basis.
      
      Aside from managing attendance, an online attendance system serves as an efficient tool of communication between students, teachers and parents for updating purposes as well.
      
      Online attendance system for students can be integrated with your existing virtual classroom software to manage grades, behavioral reports, timesheet, etc. Most such platforms help in maintaining attendance records based on class wise, day wise and subject wise basis.</p>
